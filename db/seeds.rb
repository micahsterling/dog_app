# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# dog = Dog.new(name: "Peanut", breed: "Terrier mix", age: 1)
# dog.save
# dog = Dog.new(name: "Coach", breed: "Lab", age: 0.5)
# dog.save
# dog = Dog.new(name: "Levine", breed: "Beagle", age: 2)
# dog.save
# dog = Dog.new(name: "Gaston", breed: "Beagle", age: 3)
# dog.save
# dog = Dog.new(name: "Cookie", breed: "Husky mix", age: 3)
